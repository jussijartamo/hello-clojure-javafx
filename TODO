- When fold, call options disappear the middle block moves
  -- FIX THIS

- Better feedback on opponent decisions
   - show changes on balance for both player and opponent
   - briefly halt game on opponent action (animation or confirm dialog)
   - animation with click to end could be optimal

- Implement all-in

- Wavy win animation banner (and lost animation banner)

- Player skills
Some skills have probability to activate. Some have limited uses per match.
   Probability:
   - Check-random-card-or-ranking
   - Check-worst-ranking-other-than-high-card
   - Check-best-ranking
   Limited uses:
   - Cancel-round-and-return-the-pot (amnesia)
   - Additional-draw-on-self
   - Mind-read-and-lock-that-as-next-action-for-opponent
   - Manipulation-choose-next-action-for-opponent-other-than-fold
   - Manipulation-allow-fold-as-option
   - Forced-draw-on-opponent
   - Force-strategy-on-opponent
   - Force-raise-streak-on-opponent
   Mutators:
   - No-draw
   - Opponent-forces-draw
   - Asymmetric-cost-multipliers (cheaper for opponent to raise)

Return sanity on poker round resolving
Currently:
FOLD = (-> state (override {:poker-state :fold}) (initialize-round))
RAISE = (raise state)
"MAIN ACTION" = (case poker-state :draw (draw state) :call (call state))
"AKNOWLEDGE END OF ROUND" = (initialize-round state)

Simplified:
During poker states: draw, call
[:draw :raise :fold ...] (available-actions state)
During poker states: victory, loss, tie, opponent-fold
[:ok] (available-actions state)
When player takes action just call: (take-action action) and let the magic happen
